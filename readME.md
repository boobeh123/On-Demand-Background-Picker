## Description
A web application that draws 2D objects, updates the position of the object, and animates the frames to move the object.
This project uses the built-in Canvas API to create 2D graphics.  


## Demo
![TBD](![TBD](odbpdemo.gif))

## Features
* Objects can collide against the edge of a screen
* Objects can collide against other objects
* Object size, color, and speed can change

## Technologies

### What did you learn?
* HTML: The canvas tag
* CSS: A better understanding of viewport and absolute positioning
* JavaScript: Canvas API, circle collision algorithm, and practice with object-oriented programming
* Git: Version control of a project start to finish

## Optimizations
* I want to be able to clear my canvas completely. This will allow me to switch between trail and ball animations without refreshing the page.
* I don't know why spam clicking an animation eventlistener increases the velocity of the ball objects.
